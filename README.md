# Tactics Unit Testing

This is intended to be a temporary repository as we develop our ability to accurately and completely capture animation data from the original game.

## Requirements
* Node.js

## Development
After checking out the Git repository, run these commands.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The start command will output a URL that can be used to run the game and build JavaScript bundles for use by that URL.  The command will continue to monitor source files and rebuild the bundles as changes are made.
